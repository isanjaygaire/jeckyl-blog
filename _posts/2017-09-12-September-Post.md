This was Grasmere Lake on a September evening. I took the shot from the point that the lake pours down into the neighbouring Rydal lake. In order to capture the full range of light I used two separate RAW images and created two HDR images from them. Then I combined them keeping the lighter details from one, and the darker details from the other.
